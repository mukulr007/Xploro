            <h4>This Policy applies to all users of the Services</h4>
            <p>This Policy applies to your use of the Services, whether you are Client or an End User of the Services, including in connection with one or more events (each, an “Event”).

            <h4>We collect information from and about you</h4>
            <p><strong class="bold">Information you provide as you use the Services.</strong> When you register for an Xploryo account, you must provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as name and email address. You may also voluntarily choose to provide us with personal information as you use the Services, including, without limitation, by completing your profile and registering for and interacting with others in connection with one or more Events. This may include personal information about you, such as your address, phone number and company name (if you are a Client). If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">Information we collect from you passively. </strong> We automatically collect certain information about you as you use the Services, including, without limitation, through cookies on the Xploryo website and in-app tracking when you use our Apps. This may include information about your device (such as your Unique Device Identifier), your location, your Internet usage, and how you interact with the Services. This may include information about the way you use the Services, the parts of our Services you use, any Event sessions you may attend, and third party apps or websites you visit when you leave our Services.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">Information we collect from third parties.</strong> If you are an End User, we may receive information about you from a Client, and we may collect information from your social media accounts if you choose to give us permission to access your social media accounts.  We may also work with third parties who collect information about you when you use our app. For example, our vendors might use scripts or other tools to track your activities on our Services. They may do this to make sure our Services function properly.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>We use information about you as disclosed and described here</h4>
            <p><strong class="bold">We use information to administer and provide the core functionality of the Services.</strong> For example, we use your information, such as your contact information, in connection with any Events or Event sessions for which you register.</p>

            <p><strong class="bold">We may use information for security purposes.</strong> We may use information to protect our company, a Client, and/or our website and apps.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">We may use information for promotional purposes.</strong> For example, we might provide you with information about new features, updates, new products or special offers from time to time.

          </li>

            <h4>We may share information with third parties</h4>
            <p><strong class="bold">We will share information to provide the functionality of the Services.</strong> These are third parties who perform services on our behalf. For example, we may share information with external social media services if an End User elects to cross-publish a post. We may also share information with our vendors who provide payment processing, hosting, customer support, email marketing and other services to us.  If you are an End User, we will also share your information (including your personal and contact information and information about your engagement on the Services such as any Event sessions you attend) with the Client associated with your account in order to provide the functionality of the Services. The Client may contact you in relation to one or more Events for which you have registered (including through push notification on your device), or for their own marketing and promotional purposes. In certain cases, we may also share attendee behavior information, including how you interact with the Services, in connection with one or more Events organized by our Clients. While this information may not personally identify you on its own, this information may be combined with other personally-identifiable information, either by us or the Client.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">We may share information to comply with the law.</strong> We will also share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order, subpoena, or a request from a government agency or investigatory body. We might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business.</strong> For example, if all or a part of our business was sold, we may share information as part of that transaction.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">We may otherwise share information with your permission.</strong></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>You have certain choices about sharing and marketing practices</h4>

Even if you opt out of getting marketing messages, we will still send you transactional messages. These include responses to your questions.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">You can control cookies and other browser-based tracking tools.</strong> For example, your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other browser-based tracking tools. Please note that if you block cookies, certain features on the Xploryo website may not work.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">Our Do Not Track Policy:</strong> Some browsers have “do not track” features that allow you to tell a website not to track you. These features are not all uniform. We do not currently respond to those signals.</p>
            <p><strong class="bold">You can control tools on your mobile devices.</strong> For example, you can turn off the GPS locator or push notifications on your phone. Please note that turning off certain tools on your mobile device may affect the functionality of certain features of the Services.</p>

            <p><u>Data Protection Laws</u>. If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”) or Switzerland, you are entitled to certain protections under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and/or other applicable laws (collectively, the “Data Protection Laws”), and this section applies to your use of the Services. As used in this section, the terms “processing,” “processor,” “controller” and “personal data” have the meaning given to them in the Data Protection Laws.</p>
            <p><u>How we obtain your personal data</u>. Generally, we obtain your personal data from you because you want to use the Services. In order to use the Services (for example, to attend a Client’s Event), you will need to register for the Services and create an Xploryo account. Without providing this information, you will not be able to use the Services. You may also voluntarily provide additional personal data in order to make greater use of the Services, and we may collect personal data about you (such as your IP address) to provide the functionality of the Services. Finally, we may obtain your name and contact information from a Client in connection with one or more Events. Please refer to the section of this Policy titled “We collect information from and about you” for more information. </p>
            <p><u>Our role with respect to your personal data</u>. When we process your personal data on behalf of our Client for the purpose of providing the Services, we act as a processor of your personal data, as defined under the Data Protection Laws. In such situations, the controller(s) of your personal data, as defined under the Data Protection Laws, are any Client(s) who organize any Event(s) which you attend. You may be able to find the contact information of the relevant Client by looking at the Event they posted. However, when we process your personal data for our own purposes (such as improving the Services), we may be considered the controller of your personal data for purposes of such processing. </p>
            <p><u>Purposes and legal bases for processing</u>. Your personal data will be processed for the purposes described in this Policy. Refer to the section titled “We use information about you as disclosed and described here” for how we process your personal data, and to the section titled “We use information about you as disclosed and described here” for how our Clients may process your personal data.

              <li><p>it is necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations; and/or</p></li>
              <li><p>the processing is in our legitimate interest as a provider of the Services. Such interests include the protection of the security and integrity of our systems, our direct marketing (which you can opt out of) and providing you with customer service and the core functionality of the Service.</p></li>
            </ul>
            <p><u>Categories of recipients of personal data</u>. Your personal data will be shared by us described in this Policy.

For example, we may store your personal data as long as your personal data is posted on or connected with any Events that you have attended. We may also store your personal data as long as required by law.</p>
            <p><u>International transfer of personal data</u>. Please also note that you are transferring your personal data outside of those regions to the United States of America (“US”) for storage and processing.

Under certain circumstances, we may be liable for the transfer of personal data that we receive and subsequently transfer to a third party, as described in the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
            <p>Additionally, please note that, if you believe that any processing of personal data relating to you infringes the Data Protection Laws, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your country of residence, place of work or place of an alleged infringement.</p>
            <p><u>Your rights</u>. Finally, you may have certain rights under the Data Protection Laws with respect to your personal data.
